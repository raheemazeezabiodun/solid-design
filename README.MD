#### Solid Principle

I love documenting things so I created this Repo to document the S.O.L.I.D Principle

- [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/raheemazeezabiodun/solid-design/tree/master/Single%20Responsiblity%20Principle)
- [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/raheemazeezabiodun/solid-design/tree/master/Open%20Closed%20Principle)


If you will love to learn what Solid is or learn more, you can check out this course <https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/principles-oo-design>
